1. Create a folder on Desktop named "streamlit" and create a file named "my_app.py" inside it.

2. Create virtual environment

   a. method 1: from terminal 

   python -m venv env_name 

   b. method 2 : from anaconda

   create environment (by mouse)

3. activate env (you can skip this step if you use anaconda)

   source env_name/Scripts/activate  
   (if not works try without source)  

   (in linux/mac machines "bin" instead of Scripts: see below) 
   source env_name/bin/activate 

   (python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip) if required

   (just "deactivate" to deactivate the venv)


   (if you want to create conda env: see below)
   conda create -n env_name 
   conda env list
   activate env_name
   

4. add packages into venv

  a. method 1: 

   pip install streamlit
   pip install sklearn

or 
 
   b. method 2:       
   (if you already have requirement file)
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt

"""(pip list) to see the packages
   (pip freeze > requirements.txt) to create requirement file""""
   
   
  (python -V)
  (streamlit version)

5. streamlit run my_app.py
