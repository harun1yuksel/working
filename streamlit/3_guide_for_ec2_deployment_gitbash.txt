1.Push the following files to the github 

-saved model
-app.py file (streamlit commands)
-requirements.txt and other files

2. open your aws console

3. Open EC2 Dashboard and Launch Instance (t2.micro )
   - aws linux machine
   - t2.micro 
   - Key pair login- create a new key pair-default settings
   - Name your key pem and download it
   - store your key pair on your computer
     

4. Security Group Settings

   - click the check box on the new instance 
   - Security (On the right side of details from the bottom part)
   - Security groups-Edit inbound rules-Add rule

5. Due to we want our app to be public we should set following configurations:

   (Add Rule 2 times by clicking on Add Rule button)

   a. Rule-1: Select "Custom TCP Rule" and set 8501 as port range and 0000 in soruce column (Anywhere IPv4)
   b. Rule-2: Select "Custom TCP Rule" and set 8502 as port range and 0000 in soruce column (Anywhere IPv4)

Together with the default rule (starting with SSH) there will be 3 rules.


6. Connect to instance 

   a. Open the githbash here where you save your pem file
   
   b. Conncect to instance using ssh commands 

      -click connect from aws console (ssh client)
      -copy the example
      -type yes and enter

7. to see the python versions on your ec2

type python then ("exit()" to escape)
 
type python3 ("exit()" to escape)

(to insall python3 if there is no python3:)    

$ sudo yum install python3.7


8. to update python: 

    sudo yum update -y 

9. install git to ec2

$ sudo yum install git

10. Copy app files into ec2

a. method 1 : use git clone method:

      $ git clone https://github.com/richardclarusway/inclass_streamlit.git

  (before that you need to copy the htpps addres from your git accout)

b. Method 2: if you are using vs code:

   - Create folder in ec2 ("mkdir foldername" from terminal) 
   - change directory to new folder
     cd foldername
   - Copy files from desktop into new folder

(rm -rf folder_name    --- to delet the folder with the files inside it)

c. method 3: 
 
if you cannot copy via vscode use secure copy method:

   scp -i richard_new_3.pem requirements.txt ec2-user@52.71.254.30:/home/ec2-user/streamlit6
                  
   (your keypair should at the same the directory with target data)


11. cd to folder downloaded from github (cd: change directory)

12. Create venv 

    python3 -m venv env_name

13. activate venv (maybe pip required -----python -m pip3 install -U pip3-------)
  
    source env_name/bin/activate

14. install required packages inside this folder s(foldername) in ec2

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

or to install manually

  - pip3 install scikit-learn==1.0.2st 
    or (sudo python3.7 -m pip3 install scikit-learn==1.0.2)
  - pip3 install streamlit==1.10.0  
    or (sudo python3.7 -m pip install streamlit==1.10.0)


(pip3 list) to see the packages
(pip3 freeze > requirements.txt) to create requirement file


15. streamlit run app.py

You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  Network URL: http://172.31.28.28:8501
  External URL: http://18.188.133.122:8501


(When you close the git bash no matter the instance is working the app will stop. 
To prevent the app from this or in other words to let it work even you exit from the gitbash you should install tmux)

16. "Control C" to stop running app

17. install the tmux

$ sudo yum install tmux

18. create a new tmux session

# tmux new -s st_instance

19. run the app 

$ streamlit run app.py

Then it is ok. Even if you close the gitbash or what ever you are using for linux, the app will continue to work.

You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.                                                                                     
Network URL: http://172.31.21.107:8501                                        
External URL: http://3.17.161.155:8501 

20. to detach from tmux session

"control b" then remove your fingers from keyboard then "d"


(if you again want to attach: tmux attach -t st_instance)
(and if you want to stop your app : Control+c inside the tmux session)

21. to kill the session
tmux kill-session -t st_instance
